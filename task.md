Tasks Unit 12. Using JavaScript files

1. Make sure that the app is configured to generate JavaScript files, not CoffeeScript files.
2. Rename `app/assets/javascripts/ideas.coffee` to `app/assets/javascripts/ideas.js`. Define an empty object, `Ideas`, within it.
3. Refactor `ideas/destroy.js.erb` by moving the implementation to a function called  removeIdeaCard in the Ideas object. Call this function from `ideas/destroy.js.erb`, rendering the `@idea.id` as a JavaScript String parameter for the `removeIdeaCard` function.
4. Rename `app/assets/javascripts/comments.coffee` to  `app/assets/javascripts/comments.js`. Define an empty object, `Comments`, within it.
5. Refactor `comments/create.js.erb` by moving the functionality to a function called  `displayComment` in the `Comments` object. It'll be necessary to pass the comment body, relative time, and creator's name to this function. This is best achieved by passing a single JavaScript object with properties for each value. Call the `displayComment` function from `comments/create.js.erb`, rendering the comment body, relative time, and comment creator's name as String properties for a JavaScript object that gets passed as the parameter for `displayComment`. As always, be careful to include ERB expressions within the quotes for JavaScript literal Strings. _Optionally organize the code within `displayComment` into smaller individual JavaScript functions_.
